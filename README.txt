This repository contains full template for ATAC-seq workflow.
This includes quality control, adapter trimming, file conversions, gatherings stats, calling peaks and detecting differentially accessible regions (DARs).
I also added R scripts to test different variants of normalization and scaling available in DiffBind and a script with full DiffBind analysis followed by term enrichment.
